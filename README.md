#HTML_PCB_Lib

This project is a public repository for my repair endeavours, where I store 
my analysis of device PCBs. I've searched for a long time for a nice format 
in which PCB debuging and analysis data can easily, visually and conveniently
be stored. High resolution images, stitched together from microscope images, 
overlayed with an HTML image map can easily be viewed with any webbrowser 
and deliver the information when the mouse hovers over a certain area of the 
image. 

There are multiple projects on the internet where one can create such an image
map oneself. Active areas can be drawn, redrawn and moved and any information can
be added and consequently viewed when hovering over this selective area.
These web based tools could also be downloaded for offline use
with httrack on Linux in the terminal.
